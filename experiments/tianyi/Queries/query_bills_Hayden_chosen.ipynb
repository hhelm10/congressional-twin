    "#-- Summary: This bill includes provisions on two separate subjects: 1) the domestic production of semiconductors and incentives for science and technology research and development and 2) supplemental funding for U.S. marshals and other officers to protect the Supreme Court and its justices and staff from \"threats.\"\n",
    "#The bill began as a funding bill for the legislative branch.

On July 27, 2022, additional unrelated provisions related to domestic semiconductor production (the CHIPS Act of 2022) and science and technology research and development (the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act) were added.\n",
